<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Each government engaged in the European War has issued a White,
Green, Blue or Yellow Book, explaining the causes which led to its
entry into the great conflict.</p>

<p>These books are all interesting, and are full of valuable
documentary information; but, if the busy people of America are to
understand the reasons for their own participation in the war, some
shorter cut to the desired end must be devised.</p>

<p>We, therefore, offer a BLACK AND WHITE BOOK, in which our nation's
reasons for going to war are set forth in pictures, a universal
language which can be read at a glance by any one who has eyes to
see.</p>

<p>On August 1st, 1914, we were at peace with all the world. We were
bound by ties of blood to every race on earth.</p>

<p>Particularly close and intimate were our relations with the German
people, whom we welcomed to our shores as among our most desirable
citizens.</p>

<p>Then, far away from us, apart from our interests or
concerns&mdash;like a tragedy being played on the other side of
the footlights&mdash;broke the frightful war of 1914. We looked on
fascinated, but not convinced of the reality of its cruelty.</p>

<p>For a little over eight months we watched it, when, on April 22nd,
1915, there appeared in the New York papers an advertisement stating
that the great passenger ship &ldquo;LUSITANIA&rdquo; would sail on the 7th of May
for Liverpool.</p>

<p>In the next column, in equally conspicuous type, appeared a sinister
warning to Americans, telling them to keep off the seas at peril of
their lives. This was signed, &ldquo;IMPERIAL GERMAN EMBASSY, Washington,
D. C.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On May 7th came the fulfilment of the threat, and we awoke to the
fact that we were not an audience looking at a tragedy, but the victims
of the tragedy itself.</p>

<p>Not until then was it brought home to us that our good German
friends, whom we thought we knew so well, had been inoculated with the
virus of a Junker madness, and that we were dealing with a people who
had cast from them every restraint of fair fighting and had become the
outlaw nation of the world.</p>

<p>In the following pictures the Artist has attempted to show &ldquo;Why we
are at war.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>A SILENT COMPANY&mdash;Yet its voice is heard above the roar of Cannon.</h2>

<p>On May 7th, 1915, by order of the Imperial German Government, a
&ldquo;U&rdquo; boat torpedoed the great ship Lusitania without warning, drowning
over 1,200 passengers. A sea crime unequaled by any pirate known to
history.</p>

<h2>"From now on we will make no forward movement."</h2>

<p>Making a virtue, perhaps, of necessity, the German Government
announced, in February, 1916, that &ldquo;from now on it would make no
forward movement.&rdquo; Events since have proved how well it realized its
true condition.</p>

<p>It was stated in a cable from Amsterdam, that, by the Kaiser's
direct personal order, issued about three weeks after the first attack
on Verdun, to the Court painter, a great historical painting was to
be made, called &ldquo;The Triumph of the Hohenzollerns.&rdquo; Accordingly the
painter, with costumes, horses, models, and a corps of photographers
and assistants, mobilized his forces on an eminence overlooking
Verdun.</p>
